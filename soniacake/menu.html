        <p id="uno">Page 2. On this page, we will display different cakes that the company has done in the past for other customers so the clients can get ideas of what to order or maybe collect ideas for their birthday parties or special events. On this page, we will also describe the things we can do in the future. This page is basically our menu page because people will see our products and some of our prices to know how much they are going to spend if they require our services. On this page, we will display some recipes in order to interact with our customers and show that we not only bake cakes but we have a great customer service experience waiting for them. Some activities that visitors to this site will do are to find good ideas for their parties, find good recipes, and get good information about us so they can talk to us and we can help them better.
            On this page, we will find a lot of pictures not only about cakes, but also about other desserts, parties, and even the baking process so people can get engaged in the page and not leave it when they get the information they wanted to get.</p>
