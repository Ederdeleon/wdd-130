On this page, we will display some recipes in order to interact with our customers and show that we not only bake cakes but we have a great customer service experience waiting for them.

        Page 3. On this page, we will request information from the customers, we will also display our personal information. We will invite people to contact us by email, phone, or in person and ask for a special deal to get a small dessert. On this web page, we will display information about where we are located, how they can pay, how they can ask us questions on social media, and how to ask for employment if they want to work with us. Visitors will use our services because we do offer the most delicious cakes, but because our web page is a place where they can get ideas, get information even without buying from us. We give to the customers even when they are not buying products from us. On this last page, we will also share information about who is in charge of the company, who actually creates the cakes, and the story behind them. In this last part, we will display information about deals if a big company or big shop wants to buy a product from us and then sell it on their own. These kinds of businesses are more confidential but they are very important for the company, so we will share an email for this kind of deal.
